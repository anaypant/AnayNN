AnayModel - updated January 2023

Goals for this version --
Implement a New AnayModel which is a module network
Goes from just one neural network class to more modular features
Original one is just the lite version

Name of the Game -- Flexibility
We want the user to have as much flexibility and ease in understanding and writing an extremely basic neural network

What we want:

object = Model()
object.add(m.Input(784))
object.add(m.)



What we got done today:
Added layers which can do dot product multiplication with other dense layers
don't really know where we are heading, let's do linear multiplication right now and get a hella basic feedforward for our model
