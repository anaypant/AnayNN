AnayModel - updated January 2023

Goals for this version --
Implement a New AnayModel which is a module network
Goes from just one neural network class to more modular features
Original one is just the lite version

Name of the Game -- Flexibility
We want the user to have as much flexibility and ease in understanding and writing an extremely basic neural network

What we want:

object = Module()
object.add(Layer(784,128))
object.add(ReLU())
object.add(Layer((128, 10)))
object.add(LogSoftmax())

What we got done today:
Added layers which can do dot product multiplication with other dense layers
don't really know where we are heading, let's do linear multiplication right now and get a hella basic feedforward for our model


Day 2:
Get a neural network which can feed forward using layers
This will mean adding a feedforward function to make each layer in the model
Model will have a list of activations for each layer, which will be an activation function

What will the inputs be? We want a 2d array that will be given into a class. This class can be called a tensor as it will hold the constructs for any 2d-matrix multiplication
